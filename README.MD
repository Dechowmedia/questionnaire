# Questionnaire

This is a small basic web application, written with Stimulus.
This is meant as an extra "fun" layer to your daily stand-up or meeting, where you end out the call asking a random question.
This is merely meant as fun, so any questions that provoke or otherwise are uncomfortable are entirely not intentional.

## Pre-requisites
This application requires [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) to run

## Installation / Running

- Git clone this repository.
- In the cloned folder run: `npm ci && npm run bs`

## Usage

The app will spawn on a local server and you can access it in your browser (typically http://localhost:5000)

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. Especially for additional questions.
There won't be any major development to this tool, as it is merely a toy.
